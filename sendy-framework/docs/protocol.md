# Sendy P2P Protocol
A network of peers that implement the sendy protocol should be able to:

 1. Persist [Channels](#Channel) that contain all application-level communication 
  1. Channel Requirements:
   1. Channels must have a randomly generated 64 byte seed and a randomly generated 32 byte salt
    1. Channels must have a symmetric key derived from the channel seed and salt
    2. Channel keys must be derived from a randomly generated 32 byte seed
    3. Channel keys are to be derived locally by a peer who possesses the seed and salt, never sent to another peer
   2. All channel [resources](#Resource) must be encrypted and authenticated whenever in transit by the channel's **symmetric key**
   3. Channels must be identifiable by a unique 32 byte identifier
    1. Channel IDs are generated by applying a hash function to the channel's seed
 2. Facilitate the creation and deletion of connections between a new peer and the nodes on the network
  1. Nodes can choose to provide authenticated public IP and port information to nodes behind a NAT


# Node
A Node is one machine that is connected to the wider network of other nodes.
A node must have available:
 * A [session certificate](#Session Certificate)
 

## Session Certificate
A node's certificate asserts ownership over their IP address and public authentication key.
Node certificates must be self-signed by the node to be considered valid authentication.

A certificate must contain:
 * The public IP address and port number of the peer claiming the certificate
 * Public authentication key
 * A timestamp and TTL for the session certificate before another must be sent
 * A valid UTF-8 username that may be at most 64 bytes in length
 * Supported [capabilities](#Capabilities) bitmask

## Capabilities
A node must advertise in its certificate wether it can provide the following services:
 * Public IP address and port notification for NAT traversal
 * 

# Channel
A channel is a container of [resources](#Resource).

# Resource
Resources are any uniquely identifiable data that can be transfered between nodes.
